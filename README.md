# Basic Sample React and Hardhat Project

# About :
Nestcoin is a filmhouse that would like to further engage with their audience. They would like to create a "currency" which would be used to reward loyal customers. The currency could later be traded for backstage passes and other perks. Interestingly, they began accepting crypto-based payments a year earlier and would like to harness the power of web3 to implement their solution.
Develop a solution to this and also a system that allows them to batch transactions together so they can distribute their currency as quickly and effectively as possible.
